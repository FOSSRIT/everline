# Installing FE Deps

## Linux

### NPM

Make sure you have npm and node. The best way to do this is using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Getting nvm is easy. Simply run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.17.2/install.sh | bash`

*The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm` and adds the source line to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`).*

You can customize the install source, directory and profile using the `NVM_SOURCE`, `NVM_DIR` and `PROFILE` variables. Eg: `curl ... | NVM_DIR=/usr/local/nvm bash` for a global install.


Once you have nvm, install the latest version of node `nvm install v0.10.24`

### Bower

To install bower (our front end javascript package manager) run `npm install -g bower`

*This installs the bower package manager globally on your box.*
